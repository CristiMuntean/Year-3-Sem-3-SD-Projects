# Software Design Projects
This repository contains the projects I developed during my Software Design Class that I took in the second semester of my third year at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. The theme of all of the projects presented here is a automobile service shop app which manages cars, owners and application users

They are all desktop apps created in Java Swing, developed using different architectural patterns

The projects are all built on top of another, each new iteration adding new functionalities and modifying the architectural pattern used. The order they were developed is the following:
1. MVP Project
2. MVVM Project
3. MVC Project
4. Client-Server Project

Each project has its own documentation which describes in detail all the available functionalities.
